# Getting started with Auto DevOps **(FREE)**

This step-by-step guide helps you use [Auto DevOps](index.md) to
deploy a project hosted on GitLab.com to Google Kubernetes Engine.

You are using the GitLab native Kubernetes integration, so you don't need
to create a Kubernetes cluster manually using the Google Cloud Platform console.
You are creating and deploying a simple application that you create from a GitLab template.

These instructions also work for a self-managed GitLab instance;
ensure your own [runners are configured](../../ci/runners/index.md) and
[Google OAuth is enabled](../../integration/google.md).

## Configure your Google account

Before creating and connecting your Kubernetes cluster to your GitLab project,
you need a [Google Cloud Platform account](https://console.cloud.google.com).
Sign in with an existing Google account, such as the one you use to access Gmail
or Google Drive, or create a new one.

1. Follow the steps described in the ["Before you begin" section](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#before-you-begin)
   of the Kubernetes Engine documentation to enable the required APIs and related services.
1. Ensure you've created a [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account)
   with Google Cloud Platform.

NOTE:
Every new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account receives [$300 in credit](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial),
and in partnership with Google, GitLab is able to offer an additional $200 for new
GCP accounts to get started with the GitLab integration with Google Kubernetes Engine.
[Follow this link](https://cloud.google.com/partners/partnercredit/?pcn_code=0014M00001h35gDQAQ#contact-form)
and apply for credit.

## Create a new project from a template

We are using a GitLab project template to get started. As the name suggests,
those projects provide a bare-bones application built on some well-known frameworks.

1. In GitLab, click the plus icon (**{plus-square}**) at the top of the navigation bar, and select
   **New project**.
1. Go to the **Create from template** tab, where you can choose among a Ruby on
   Rails, Spring, or NodeJS Express project.
   For this tutorial, use the Ruby on Rails template.

   ![Select project template](img/guide_project_template_v12_3.png)

1. Give your project a name, optionally a description, and make it public so that
   you can take advantage of the features available in the
   [GitLab Ultimate plan](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

   ![Create project](img/guide_create_project_v12_3.png)

1. Click **Create project**.

Now that you've created a project, create the Kubernetes cluster
to deploy this project to.

## Create a Kubernetes cluster from within GitLab

1. On your project's landing page, click **Add Kubernetes cluster**
   (note that this option is also available when you navigate to
   **Infrastructure > Kubernetes clusters**).

   ![Project landing page](img/guide_project_landing_page_v12_10.png)

1. On the **Add a Kubernetes cluster integration** page, click the **Create new cluster** tab,
   then click **Google GKE**.

1. Connect with your Google account, and click **Allow** to allow access to your
   Google account. (This authorization request is only displayed the first time
   you connect GitLab with your Google account.)

   After authorizing access, the **Add a Kubernetes cluster integration** page
   is displayed.

1. In the **Enter the details for your Kubernetes cluster** section, provide
   details about your cluster:

   - **Kubernetes cluster name**
   - **Environment scope** - Leave this field unchanged.
   - **Google Cloud Platform project** - Select a project. When you
     [configured your Google account](#configure-your-google-account), a project
     should have already been created for you.
   - **Zone** - The [region/zone](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) to
     create the cluster in.
   - **Number of nodes**
   - **Machine type** - For more information about
     [machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types), see Google's documentation.
   - **Enable Cloud Run for Anthos** - Select this checkbox to use the
     [Cloud Run](../../user/project/clusters/add_gke_clusters.md#cloud-run-for-anthos),
     Istio, and HTTP Load Balancing add-ons for this cluster.
   - **GitLab-managed cluster** - Select this checkbox to
     [allow GitLab to manage namespace and service accounts](../../user/project/clusters/index.md#gitlab-managed-clusters) for this cluster.

1. Click **Create Kubernetes cluster**.

After a couple of minutes, the cluster is created. You can also see its
status on your [GCP dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes).

## Install Ingress

After your cluster is running, you must install NGINX Ingress Controller as a
load balancer, to route traffic from the internet to your application. Because
you've created a Google GKE cluster in this guide, you can install NGINX Ingress Controller
through the GitLab [Cluster management project template](../../user/clusters/management_project_template.md),
or manually with Google Cloud Shell:

1. Go to your cluster's details page, and click the **Advanced Settings** tab.
1. Click the link to Google Kubernetes Engine to visit the cluster on Google Cloud Console.
1. On the GKE cluster page, select **Connect**, then click **Run in Cloud Shell**.
1. After the Cloud Shell starts, run these commands to install NGINX Ingress Controller:

   ```shell
   kubectl create ns gitlab-managed-apps
   helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
   helm repo update
   helm install ingress stable/nginx-ingress -n gitlab-managed-apps

   # Check that the ingress controller is installed successfully
   kubectl get service ingress-nginx-ingress-controller -n gitlab-managed-apps
   ```

## Configure your base domain

Follow these steps to configure the Base Domain where your apps will be accessible.

1. A few minutes after you install NGINX, the load balancer obtains an IP address, and you can
   get the external IP address with the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl get service ingress-nginx-ingress-controller -n gitlab-managed-apps -ojson | jq -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip'
   ```

   Replace `gitlab-managed-apps` if you have overwritten your namespace.

   Copy this IP address, as you need it in the next step.

1. Go back to the cluster page on GitLab, and go to the **Details** tab.
   - Add your **Base domain**. For this guide, use the domain `<IP address>.nip.io`.
   - Click **Save changes**.

   ![Cluster Base Domain](img/guide_base_domain_v12_3.png)

## Enable Auto DevOps (optional)

While Auto DevOps is enabled by default, Auto DevOps can be disabled at both
the instance level (for self-managed instances) and the group level. Complete
these steps to enable Auto DevOps if it's disabled:

1. Navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Auto DevOps**, and click **Expand**.
1. Select **Default to Auto DevOps pipeline** to display more options.
1. In **Deployment strategy**, select your desired [continuous deployment strategy](index.md#deployment-strategy)
   to deploy the application to production after the pipeline successfully runs on the default branch.
1. Click **Save changes**.

   ![Auto DevOps settings](img/guide_enable_autodevops_v12_3.png)

After you save your changes, GitLab creates a new pipeline. To view it, go to
**{rocket}** **CI/CD > Pipelines**.

In the next section, we explain what each job does in the pipeline.

## Deploy the application

When your pipeline runs, what is it doing?

To view the jobs in the pipeline, click the pipeline's status badge. The
**{status_running}** icon displays when pipeline jobs are running, and updates
without refreshing the page to **{status_success}** (for success) or
**{status_failed}** (for failure) when the jobs complete.

The jobs are separated into stages:

![Pipeline stages](img/guide_pipeline_stages_v13_0.png)

- **Build** - The application builds a Docker image and uploads it to your project's
  [Container Registry](../../user/packages/container_registry/index.md) ([Auto Build](stages.md#auto-build)).
- **Test** - GitLab runs various checks on the application, but all jobs except `test`
  are allowed to fail in the test stage:

  - The `test` job runs unit and integration tests by detecting the language and
    framework ([Auto Test](stages.md#auto-test))
  - The `code_quality` job checks the code quality and is allowed to fail
    ([Auto Code Quality](stages.md#auto-code-quality))
  - The `container_scanning` job checks the Docker container if it has any
    vulnerabilities and is allowed to fail ([Auto Container Scanning](stages.md#auto-container-scanning))
  - The `dependency_scanning` job checks if the application has any dependencies
    susceptible to vulnerabilities and is allowed to fail
    ([Auto Dependency Scanning](stages.md#auto-dependency-scanning)) **(ULTIMATE)**
  - Jobs suffixed with `-sast` run static analysis on the current code to check for potential
    security issues, and are allowed to fail ([Auto SAST](stages.md#auto-sast)) **(ULTIMATE)**
  - The `secret-detection` job checks for leaked secrets and is allowed to fail ([Auto Secret Detection](stages.md#auto-secret-detection)) **(ULTIMATE)**
  - The `license_scanning` job searches the application's dependencies to determine each of their
    licenses and is allowed to fail
    ([Auto License Compliance](stages.md#auto-license-compliance)) **(ULTIMATE)**

- **Review** - Pipelines on the default branch include this stage with a `dast_environment_deploy` job.
  To learn more, see [Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)](../../user/application_security/dast/index.md).

- **Production** - After the tests and checks finish, the application deploys in
  Kubernetes ([Auto Deploy](stages.md#auto-deploy)).

- **Performance** - Performance tests are run on the deployed application
  ([Auto Browser Performance Testing](stages.md#auto-browser-performance-testing)). **(PREMIUM)**

- **Cleanup** - Pipelines on the default branch include this stage with a `stop_dast_environment` job.

After running a pipeline, you should view your deployed website and learn how
to monitor it.

### Monitor your project

After successfully deploying your application, you can view its website and check
on its health on the **Environments** page by navigating to
**Deployments > Environments**. This page displays details about
the deployed applications, and the right-hand column displays icons that link
you to common environment tasks:

![Environments](img/guide_environments_v12_3.png)

- **Open live environment** (**{external-link}**) - Opens the URL of the application deployed in production
- **Monitoring** (**{chart}**) - Opens the metrics page where Prometheus collects data
  about the Kubernetes cluster and how the application
  affects it in terms of memory usage, CPU usage, and latency
- **Deploy to** (**{play}** **{angle-down}**) - Displays a list of environments you can deploy to
- **Terminal** (**{terminal}**) - Opens a [web terminal](../../ci/environments/index.md#web-terminals)
  session inside the container where the application is running
- **Re-deploy to environment** (**{repeat}**) - For more information, see
  [Retrying and rolling back](../../ci/environments/index.md#retry-or-roll-back-a-deployment)
- **Stop environment** (**{stop}**) - For more information, see
  [Stopping an environment](../../ci/environments/index.md#stopping-an-environment)

GitLab displays the [Deploy Board](../../user/project/deploy_boards.md) below the
environment's information, with squares representing pods in your
Kubernetes cluster, color-coded to show their status. Hovering over a square on
the deploy board displays the state of the deployment, and clicking the square
takes you to the pod's logs page.

NOTE:
The example shows only one pod hosting the application at the moment, but you can add
more pods by defining the [`REPLICAS` CI/CD variable](customize.md#cicd-variables)
in **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.

### Work with branches

Following the [GitLab flow](../gitlab_flow.md#working-with-feature-branches),
you should next create a feature branch to add content to your application:

1. In your project's repository, navigate to the following file: `app/views/welcome/index.html.erb`.
   This file should only contain a paragraph: `<p>You're on Rails!</p>`.
1. Open the GitLab [Web IDE](../../user/project/web_ide/index.md) to make the change.
1. Edit the file so it contains:

   ```html
   <p>You're on Rails! Powered by GitLab Auto DevOps.</p>
   ```

1. Stage the file. Add a commit message, then create a new branch and a merge request
   by clicking **Commit**.

   ![Web IDE commit](img/guide_ide_commit_v12_3.png)

After submitting the merge request, GitLab runs your pipeline, and all the jobs
in it, as [described previously](#deploy-the-application), in addition to
a few more that run only on branches other than the default branch.

![Merge request](img/guide_merge_request_v12_3.png)

After a few minutes a test fails, which means a test was
'broken' by your change. Click on the failed `test` job to see more information
about it:

```plaintext
Failure:
WelcomeControllerTest#test_should_get_index [/app/test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb:7]:
<You're on Rails!> expected but was
<You're on Rails! Powered by GitLab Auto DevOps.>..
Expected 0 to be >= 1.

bin/rails test test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb:4
```

To fix the broken test:

1. Return to the **Overview** page for your merge request, and click **Open in Web IDE**.
1. In the left-hand directory of files, find the `test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb`
   file, and click it to open it.
1. Change line 7 to say `You're on Rails! Powered by GitLab Auto DevOps.`
1. Click **Commit**.
1. In the left-hand column, under **Unstaged changes**, click the checkmark icon
   (**{stage-all}**) to stage the changes.
1. Write a commit message, and click **Commit**.

Return to the **Overview** page of your merge request, and you should not only
see the test passing, but also the application deployed as a
[review application](stages.md#auto-review-apps). You can visit it by clicking
the **View app** **{external-link}** button to see your changes deployed.

![Review app](img/guide_merge_request_review_app_v12_3.png)

After merging the merge request, GitLab runs the pipeline on the default branch,
and then deploys the application to production.
