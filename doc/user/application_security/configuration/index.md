- **Manage:** A management option or a documentation link.

WARNING:
This feature might not be available to you. Check the **version history** note above for details.

The Security Configuration page has been redesigned in GitLab Free and Premium.
The same functionality exists as before, but presented in a more extensible
way.

For each security control the page displays:

- Its name, description and a documentation link.
- Whether or not it is available.
- A configuration button or a link to its configuration guide.

## Status **(ULTIMATE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20711) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.6.

The status of each security control is determined by the project's latest default branch
[CI pipeline](../../../ci/pipelines/index.md).
If a job with the expected security report artifact exists in the pipeline, the feature's status is
_enabled_.

If the latest pipeline used [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md),
all security features are configured by default.

For SAST, click **View history** to see the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file's history.

## Manage **(ULTIMATE)**

You can configure the following security controls:

- Auto DevOps
  - Click **Enable Auto DevOps** to enable it for the current project. For more details, see [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md).
- SAST
  - Click either **Enable** or **Configure** to use SAST for the current project. For more details, see [Configure SAST in the UI](../sast/index.md#configure-sast-in-the-ui).
- DAST Profiles
  - Click **Manage** to manage the available DAST profiles used for on-demand scans. For more details, see [DAST on-demand scans](../dast/index.md#on-demand-scans).
- Secret Detection
  - Select **Configure via Merge Request** to create a merge request with the changes required to
    enable Secret Detection. For more details, see [Enable Secret Detection via an automatic merge request](../secret_detection/index.md#enable-secret-detection-via-an-automatic-merge-request).

## Enable or disable UI redesign **(FREE SELF)**

The Security Configuration redesign is under development, but is ready for
production use. It is deployed behind a feature flag that is **disabled by
default**.
[GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) can enable it.

To enable it:

```ruby
# For the instance
Feature.enable(:security_configuration_redesign)
# For a single project
Feature.enable(:security_configuration_redesign, Project.find(<project id>))
```

To disable it:

```ruby
# For the instance
Feature.disable(:security_configuration_redesign)
# For a single project
Feature.disable(:security_configuration_redesign, Project.find(<project id>))
```
