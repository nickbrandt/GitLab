# GraphQL API Resources

This documentation is self-generated based on GitLab current GraphQL schema.

The API can be explored interactively using the [GraphiQL IDE](../index.md#graphiql).

Each table below documents a GraphQL type. Types match loosely to models, but not all
fields and methods on a model are available via GraphQL.

WARNING:
Fields that are deprecated are marked with **{warning-solid}**.
Items (fields, enums, etc) that have been removed according to our [deprecation process](../index.md#deprecation-and-removal-process) can be found
in [Removed Items](../removed_items.md).
