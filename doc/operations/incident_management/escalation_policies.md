# Escalation Policies **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4638) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 14.0.

Escalation Policies contain time boxed steps that will automatically page a responder in the next escalation step if the responder in the step before has not responded. To protect your company from missed critical alerts, create an escalation policy in the GitLab project where you manage [on-call schedules](./oncall_schedules.md).

## Add an escalation policy

If you have at least Maintainer [permissions](../../user/permissions.md) you can create an escalation policy. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Operations > Escalation Policies** and select **Add an escalation policy**.
1. In the **Add escalation policy** form, enter the policy's name, description, and create escalation rules that will be followed when alert is missed by a primary responder.
1. Click **Add escalation policy**.
