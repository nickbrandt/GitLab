# Escalation Policies **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4638) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 14.0.

Escalation Policies protect your company from missed critical alerts. Escalation Policies contain
time-boxed steps that automatically page the next responder in the escalation step if the responder
in the previous step has not responded. You can create an escalation policy in the GitLab project
where you manage [On-call schedules](oncall_schedules.md).

## Add an escalation policy

If you have at least Maintainer [permissions](../../user/permissions.md),
you can create an escalation policy:

1. Go to **Operations > Escalation Policies** and select **Add an escalation policy**.
1. In the **Add escalation policy** form, enter the policy's name and description, and create
   escalation rules to follow when a primary responder misses an alert.
1. Select **Add escalation policy**.
