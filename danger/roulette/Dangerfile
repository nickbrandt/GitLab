## Reviewer roulette

Changes that require review have been detected! A merge request is normally
reviewed by both a reviewer and a maintainer in its primary category (e.g.
~frontend or ~backend), and by a maintainer in all other categories.
MARKDOWN

CATEGORY_TABLE_HEADER = <<MARKDOWN

To spread load more evenly across eligible reviewers, Danger has picked a candidate for each
review slot, based on their timezone. Feel free to
[override these selections](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab)
if you think someone else would be better-suited
or use the [GitLab Review Workload Dashboard](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/) to find other available reviewers.

To read more on how to use the reviewer roulette, please take a look at the
[Engineering workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#basics)
and [code review guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html).
Please consider assigning a reviewer or maintainer who is a
[domain expert](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab) in the area of the merge request.

Once you've decided who will review this merge request, assign them as a reviewer!
Danger does not automatically notify them for you.

UNKNOWN_FILES_MESSAGE = <<MARKDOWN

These files couldn't be categorised, so Danger was unable to suggest a reviewer.
Please consider creating a merge request to
[add support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/tooling/danger/project_helper.rb)
for them.
