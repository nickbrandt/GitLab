  # instead of calling g++ directly you can also use some build toolkit like make
  # install the necessary build tools when needed
  # before_script:
  #   - apt update && apt -y install make autoconf
  script:
    - g++ helloworld.cpp -o mybinary
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - mybinary
      # depending on your build setup it's most likely a good idea to cache outputs to reduce the build time
      # cache:
      #   paths:
      #     - "*.o"

# run tests using the binary built before
