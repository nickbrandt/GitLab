# This service computes the timebox's(milestone, iteration) daily total number of issues and their weights.
# For each day, this returns the totals for all issues that are assigned to the timebox(milestone, iteration) at that point in time.
# This represents the scope for this timebox(milestone, iteration). This also returns separate totals for closed issues which represent the completed work.
#
# This is implemented by iterating over all relevant resource events ordered by time. We need to do this
# so that we can keep track of the issue's state during that point in time and handle the events based on that.
