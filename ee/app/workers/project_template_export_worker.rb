# ProjectTemplateExportWorker is identical to ProjectExportWorker
# with the only exception of having higher urgency (low instead of throttled)
# and separate queue in order to allow users to create projects
# from custom templates faster, without getting stuck in the queue,
# since project_export queue can get congested by export requests
# which significantly delays project creation from custom templates.
