    # booleans as values and sets cache expiry only on the initial access of
    # the overall resource cache. As such the cache will expire roughly daily
    # to ensure we don't grow unbounded in size with cached values for records
    # that are not recently accessed.
    #
    # Under the hood this is implemented using a Redis Hash and deleting is
    # just a `DEL` of the entire Hash. This kind of cache is preferred to the
    # normal Rails cache implemented as normal Redis key/value because we need
    # to invalidate the entire cache when we do invalidation which is too
